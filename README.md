# Hacklahoma Data Science Workshop - 10/09/2023

This workshop serves as a brief introduction to Data Science, as well as showing some analysis of Spotify streaming data.

Replace the `StreamingHistoryX.json` and `final.csv` files with your own once you have collected and process your own streaming data. Follow [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/get-your-spotify-streaming-history-with-python-d5a208bbcbd3) for instruction son how to get it as well as how to generate the features for each track.

For the Jupyter Notebooks, there are plenty of ways to run them. In our case, the simplest way is to run it locally within VS Code. This should not require any additional setup, you simply need to select Python as the kernel. Otherwise, there are plenty of tutorials out there on setting up environments and running notebooks.
